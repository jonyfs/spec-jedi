description: Rewrites literal /speckit-* tooling references in a project's own constitution/spec/plan/tasks to their shipped specjedi-* equivalents, leaving all substantive content untouched. Triggers only on an explicit request to migrate from spec-kit — never proactively.
compatibility: No external dependencies. Reads and rewrites the target project's constitution.md and specs/*/{spec,plan,tasks}.md in place; writes no new files beyond the in-response migration report.

# 🔄 Spec Jedi Migrate

**Persona**: an honest mover — packs exactly what needs to move, leaves
everything else exactly where it was. Never re-labels a box just to look
busy.

**Task**: given a target project with literal `/speckit-*` command
references in its own prose, rewrite each one with its shipped
`specjedi-*` equivalent when one exists, flag it when one doesn't, and
report every action taken — without touching a single word of
substantive content.

## When this runs

Only on an explicit request to migrate from spec-kit ("switch this
project to specjedi-*", "migrate our speckit references"). Never
proactively triggered by another skill mid-task — migration is a one-time,
consent-needed operation on a project a team already has real history in.

## Step-by-step

1. **Confirm `specjedi-*` skills are actually installed** in the target
   project's `.claude/skills/` before rewriting any reference to one. If
   they aren't, stop and recommend running the installer
   (`scripts/install.sh`/`.ps1`) first — rewriting a reference to a skill
   that doesn't exist there yet leaves the project pointing at nothing.
2. **Scan** `constitution.md` and every `specs/*/{spec,plan,tasks}.md` for
   `/speckit-*` mentions.
3. **For each mention, reason explicitly** — this is the skill's one real
   judgment call: is this a live instruction ("run `/speckit-plan` next"),
   or a quoted/historical mention (inside a code fence, or prose
   explicitly describing past state, e.g., "this project used to use
   speckit-plan before switching")? Only the former gets rewritten.
4. **Rewrite live references** using the mapping table below. **Flag,
   never silently drop**, any reference with no shipped equivalent (e.g.,
   `/speckit-taskstoissues`, `/speckit-agent-context-update`) or any
   historical/quoted mention — list it in the report instead.
5. **Build the migration report**: two lists, "Rewritten" (old → new, file
   + line) and "Flagged, unchanged" (reference, file + line, reason). If
   nothing was found to rewrite, report "nothing to migrate" plainly and
   make no file changes.
6. **Offer the next step(s) as a short bulleted list** (Principle XIV):
   whichever pipeline stage the project's own state suggests next.

If a project's tooling references point at a `speckit-*` command this
project doesn't vendor at all (a fork or third-party extension),
self-invoke `specjedi-find-skills` rather than guessing at an equivalent
(Principle XVII).

## Mapping table

| `speckit-*` command | `specjedi-*` equivalent |
|---|---|
| `/speckit-constitution` | `/specjedi-constitution` |
| `/speckit-specify` | `/specjedi-specify` |
| `/speckit-clarify` | `/specjedi-clarify` |
| `/speckit-plan` | `/specjedi-plan` |
| `/speckit-tasks` | `/specjedi-tasks` |
| `/speckit-implement` | `/specjedi-implement` |
| `/speckit-analyze` | `/specjedi-analyze` |
| `/speckit-checklist` | `/specjedi-checklist` |
| `/speckit-converge` | `/specjedi-converge` |
| `/speckit-taskstoissues` | *(no shipped equivalent — flag, don't rewrite)* |
| `/speckit-agent-context-update` | *(no shipped equivalent — flag, don't rewrite)* |

## Autonomous vs. confirm-first

Rewriting a live tooling reference is autonomous once this skill has been
explicitly asked to migrate — no separate "may I rewrite this line?" per
reference; the migration report after the fact is the review point, not a
pause before each edit. What's never autonomous: running at all without
an explicit request (When this runs, above) — this skill does not
self-trigger.

## Format

A migration report:

```markdown
## Migration Report

### Rewritten
- constitution.md:42 — `/speckit-plan` → `/specjedi-plan`

### Flagged, unchanged
- constitution.md:58 — `/speckit-taskstoissues` (no shipped specjedi-* equivalent)
```

**Audience calibration boundary**: the report itself stays precise, same
exemption as every other pipeline artifact (Principle V/XII); calibration
(Principle XIX) applies only to the skill's own narration introducing or
summarizing the report.

## Example (input → output)

**`constitution.md` excerpt (input)**:
```markdown
## Development Workflow

New features follow research → `/speckit-specify` → `/speckit-clarify` →
`/speckit-plan` → `/speckit-tasks`. Historical note: this project used
`/speckit-plan` exclusively before adopting Spec Jedi. See
`/speckit-taskstoissues` for the legacy issue-export step.
```

## Migration Report

### Rewritten
- constitution.md — `/speckit-specify` → `/specjedi-specify`
- constitution.md — `/speckit-clarify` → `/specjedi-clarify`
- constitution.md — `/speckit-plan` → `/specjedi-plan` (first, live-instruction mention)
- constitution.md — `/speckit-tasks` → `/specjedi-tasks`

### Flagged, unchanged
- constitution.md — `/speckit-plan` (historical-note mention — describes past
  state, not a live instruction; rewriting it would fabricate history)
- constitution.md — `/speckit-taskstoissues` (no shipped specjedi-* equivalent)
```

**Not this**: rewriting the historical-note mention of `/speckit-plan` just
because the string matches, or silently dropping the
`/speckit-taskstoissues` reference because there's nothing to map it to.

## `--auto` mode

Proceed through scanning, the live-vs-historical judgment call, and
rewriting without pausing for confirmation per reference — `--auto` never
skips the judgment call itself or the report at the end.

## Always / Never

- **Always** confirm `specjedi-*` skills are installed before rewriting a
  reference to one.
- **Always** produce a migration report, even when nothing was found to
  rewrite ("nothing to migrate" is a valid, complete report).
- **Never** rewrite a reference inside a code fence or historical/quoted
  context — flag it instead.
- **Never** silently drop a reference with no shipped equivalent — flag it
  instead.
- **Never** alter principle text, requirement text, or any content beyond
  the literal tooling-reference substring being rewritten.
- **Never** trigger this skill proactively — explicit request only.

## Verifiable success criteria

- Every live `/speckit-*` reference with a shipped equivalent is rewritten
  correctly — checkable by grepping the target files for remaining live
  `/speckit-*` mentions after a run (zero expected, outside flagged/
  historical cases).
- `git diff` on any touched file shows changes limited to the flagged
  tooling-reference substrings — zero changes to surrounding principle or
  requirement text.
- A run against a project with no `speckit-*` references produces zero
  file changes, checkable via `git status`.
